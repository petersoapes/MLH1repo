Rmd manuscript to do

- look up how to change the citation from all authors to 1 + et al
- find how to show the degree symblol
-move all of the figures to new script

-figure how to standardize the p value sig figs
- re-write a shorter version of the variance section


total MLH1 and SC correlation

MOLF -- there is only 1 MOLF male for the total SC measures
(at least 3 are in the bivData)
MOLF come from batches, 11, 15, 16 (on of the tot-SC files is missing batch 15, 16)

I think the most complete total.SC file is SCskel_output_feb20.csv
I made a new excel file of the merged MLH1-total SC which has all updted batches AND outliers have been removed.


Q2: 
IFDs




Model result checking
Q1 MLH1; M1 -- all models sig
M2 - subsp are effects are weak
m3 - 2 strains with sig effects, MSM G,  2 strain by sex MSM and PWD
m4 - male -- PWD (7 effect)  SKIVE   MSM
m5 - female  -- G, MSM, LEW and PWD

Q1 SC length
check the t.test (total.SC) and reduced dataset
Q1. total SC
(Q1.tot.SC_t.test_FM, Q1.tot.SC_t.test_WSB)
Q1. short bivalents t-tests

Models
total.SC
M1 -- all sig (Q1.lmer_totSC_M1_results)
M2 -- sex most sig, other sig: #subsp, #strains G, LEW,  #mol * sex, #G * sex, (sum.Q1.glm_totSC_M2)
M3 -- sex most sig, (PWD more sig). G, LEW, MSM, SKIVE, KAZ,  G*male, MSM*male, (sum.Q1.glm_totSC_M3)

Short.biv
M1- sex most significant, interaction slightly sig (p = .033)  
M2 - sex most sig, Skive and skive * male   (summ.Q1.glm_short.SC_M2)
M3 - sex most sig, SKIVE * male only other  (summ.Q1.glm_short.SC_M3)


SC female : male ratios
MSM and WSB

Q1. models -- check that sex is still significant (M1-M3)
list any significant strain effects (yes for total.SC and short)


Q1 positions (p values are only slightly different)
t-test all sig, but KAZ

M1: sex most signifcant, strain-random
M2: sex most significant, LEW, G, Musc slightly sinificant
M3: sex most significant, G, LEW, KAZ, PWD*sex slightly significant


Q1 IFD 
strain sepcific t.tests -- list all of the p values -- or the highest one (threshold value) p is at least
KAZ is supposed to have non sig p value, but new value is significant
(DOUBLE CHECK THESE values)
IFD.norm

WSB - p-value = 0.03
LEW - p-value = 7e-05
G - p-value = 0.03
PWD - p-value = 9e-04
KAZ - p-value = 0.3
SKIVE - not enough females, p-value = 4e-05
MSM (3 males, 4 female curated biv data) - p-value = 0.3 (what what the previous measure? Am I missing  (8 males in full MLH1 data)

30sep16_MSM_f1 - missing from BivData
30sep16_MSM_f2 31dec17_MSM_f1 31dec17_MSM_f2  31dec17_MSM_f3 31dec17_MSM_f4
