Main report todo

- Fix the main strain MLH1 av. figure (colors?)
- merge with a chrm proportion plot


- Mixed Model, make the final model and comment out the rest
-figure out the test for random effects.

- Move the Figure code chunks to after the Mixed Model


- think of goals for feed back for doing lab meeting
    - newish / novel results (methodology logical, believeable)
	1. IFD in high rec musc
	2. sex specific IFD
	
    - XX and SC length

    - results to conclusions/discussion points

    - feedback on driving questions -- 


(find draft of discussion table, uggh how'd I lose it)



quality effect
-make a model for quality
CO_count ~ category + quality

-answer the questions at bottom


Age effect
-make model for quantifying the age effect (sort the data into onsistant groups)

-bimodal test emb and neonate within category /strain

-compile data for testing litter effect
-compile data for stain effect
-update and re-download the dissection sheets


Main Figures
-map of inbred strain sampling? (could be supplement)
-MLH1 boxplot,
-Heterochiasmy plot,

-chrm class proportion plot (similar to current, 2x2?)

-DMC1 boxplots


Main table
-MLH1 means


Supplemental figure / table list
-MLH1 count histograms
-mouse mean MLH1 histograms (assessing normality)

-repeatability plot? (r value)

Effect plots
-female embryo vs neonate
-male age effect plot



-mouse information (age ect)
