# themes across chapters

## 1. recombination rate variation in wild population

natural variation for recombiantion rate, 

how Rec evolves, parasites, stress het Environments

genetic variation and environmental effects, 


## 2. Heterochiasmy, sexspecific evolution of recombination rates




## 3. between cell variation in recombination (meiotic features)



## Figure / Image ideas

- chrom axis / DNA loop



## aim of the thesis

the aim of this thesis --- is to investigate variation and evolution of genome with recombination rates

within species variation (natural populaiton) and sex


genome wide rates -- broken down (to investigate the chromosome - level landscape / broad scale patterns / meiotic features)
