	abstract = {Despite being linked to the fundamental processes of chromosome segregation and offspring diversification, meiotic recombination rates vary within and between species. Recent years have seen progress in quantifying recombination rate evolution across multiple temporal and genomic scales. Nevertheless, the level of variation in recombination rate within wild populations—a key determinant of evolution in this trait—remains poorly documented on the genomic scale. To address this notable gap, we used immunofluorescent cytology to quantify genome-wide recombination rates in males from a wild population of the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. For comparison, we measured recombination rates in a second population of male P. leucopus raised in the laboratory and in male deer mice from the subspecies Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii. Although we found differences between individuals in the genome-wide recombination rate, levels of variation were low—within populations, between populations, and between species. Quantification of synaptonemal complex length and crossover positions along chromosome 1 using a novel automated approach also revealed conservation in broad-scale crossover patterning, including strong crossover interference. We propose stabilizing selection targeting recombination or correlated processes as the explanation for these patterns.},
