	abstract = {Sex differences in overall recombination rates are well known, but little theoretical or empirical attention has been given to how and why sexes differ in their recombination landscapes: the patterns of recombination along chromosomes. In the first scientific review of this phenomenon, we find that recombination is biased toward telomeres in males and more uniformly distributed in females in most vertebrates and many other eukaryotes. Notable exceptions to this pattern exist, however. Fine-scale recombination patterns also frequently differ between males and females. The molecular mechanisms responsible for sex differences remain unclear, but chromatin landscapes play a role. Why these sex differences evolve also is unclear. Hypotheses suggest that they may result from sexually antagonistic selection acting on coding genes and their regulatory elements, meiotic drive in females, selection during the haploid phase of the life cycle, selection against aneuploidy, or mechanistic constraints. No single hypothesis, however, can adequately explain the evolution of sex differences in all cases. Sex-specific recombination landscapes have important consequences for population differentiation and sex chromosome evolution.},

	url = {https://www.nature.com/articles/s41437-019-0252-9#Sec2},
	abstract = {Despite being linked to the fundamental processes of chromosome segregation and offspring diversification, meiotic recombination rates vary within and between species. Recent years have seen progress in quantifying recombination rate evolution across multiple temporal and genomic scales. Nevertheless, the level of variation in recombination rate within wild populations—a key determinant of evolution in this trait—remains poorly documented on the genomic scale. To address this notable gap, we used immunofluorescent cytology to quantify genome-wide recombination rates in males from a wild population of the white-footed mouse, Peromyscus leucopus. For comparison, we measured recombination rates in a second population of male P. leucopus raised in the laboratory and in male deer mice from the subspecies Peromyscus maniculatus bairdii. Although we found differences between individuals in the genome-wide recombination rate, levels of variation were low—within populations, between populations, and between species. Quantification of synaptonemal complex length and crossover positions along chromosome 1 using a novel automated approach also revealed conservation in broad-scale crossover patterning, including strong crossover interference. We propose stabilizing selection targeting recombination or correlated processes as the explanation for these patterns.},
