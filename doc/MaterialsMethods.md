### Material and Methods


#### Mouse Husbandry
(X to X mouse strains obtained from Jax labs)
(X to X mouse strains obtained from RIKEN BRC)
(Gough mice)

<mice raised in 2-3 UW facilities -- on standard breeder chow>
Some extra breeding steps for problem breeders. Including; nestlets, sunflower seeds, larger rat cages.

#### Tissue Collection
(ovaries were collected from neonates less than 24 hours old or embryos day e16 to 21). Ovaries were collected and oocyte slide spreads were 
made following (X reference) with some modifications.  (

Testes were collected from males age 6 to 12 weeks. The right testes was collected and spermatocyte spreads were perpared following X reference.

#### Immunoflourescance

Staining of meiocytes was perferomed following X protocol. (1:50) SCP3 primary antibody (Source), MLH1 pirmary antibody (Source), and centromere primary
incubated on slides for 24 hours. Secondary antibodies ... Washes. Slides were fixed with antifade (source).


#### Image Processing

Cells were imaged on X microscope. saved as .tif files. Image Processing was done in Photoshop (srouce).
