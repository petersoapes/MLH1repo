### Introduction Heterochiasmy (in rate)



Meiosis can be reduced to the expression of (2n -> 4n -> 2n -> 1n) which tracks the duplication of a diploid genome into haploid cell products. The meiotic program relies on crossovers and the process of recombination to ensure the correct separation of chromosomes. Under one of the most common forms of sexual reproduction, anisogamy where a species has distinct gametes, there is no first principle which would predict the evolution of sexually dimorphic recombination rates. Yet sexual dimorphism for this trait, called heterochiasmy, is commonly observed in dioecious species, suggesting that other meiotic traits which distinguish the gametes, for example symmetrical vs asymmetrical cell division, may impose selection for sexually dimorphic recombination rates. 



Themes?


outline

meiotic recombination is one of the major sources of genetic variation (besides mutation).
genome wide recombiantion rates have X effect on genetic variation and population genetics.

hereitable component to genome wide RR, assumed fitness effects for making gametes, and inter-population / interspecific variation. (genome wide recombination 
rates can evolve). Evidence that these rates can evolves rapidly. 

(Examples of variation in GWRR)

The source of this variation is not well understood or known. The purpose of this manusciprt is to document one of the major sources of 
interspecific GWRR, heterochiasmy or the sexual dimorphism of gwRR.

--We look at (sex-specific patterns of variation with and between sub-species of house mice and related rodents --- to start to better understand
what // how heterochiasmy evolves. (how evolutionary forces are acting on gametogenesis to affect the average number of crossovers that are formed
in a meiocyte.

#### points to make 

- importance of GWRR (a distinguished from RR)
- 1 CO per chrm
- bounds of gwRR, not well understood
- HetC is not just sex chromosomes
- differences in gametogenesis
- not many empiracal measures, we find variation within subspecies
- within and across population framework
