### Introduction

outline

meiotic recombination is one of the major sources of genetic variation (besides mutation).
genome wide recombiantion rates have X effect on genetic variation and population genetics.

hereitable component to genome wide RR, assumed fitness effects for making gametes, and inter-population / interspecific variation. (genome wide recombination 
rates can evolve). Evidence that these rates can evolves rapidly. 

(Examples of variation in GWRR)

The source of this variation is not well understood or known. The purpose of this manusciprt is to document one of the major sources of 
interspecific GWRR, heterochiasmy or the sexual dimorphism of gwRR.

--We look at (sex-specific patterns of variation with and between sub-species of house mice and related rodents --- to start to better understand
what // how heterochiasmy evolves. (how evolutionary forces are acting on gametogenesis to affect the average number of crossovers that are formed
in a meiocyte.

#### points to make 

- importance of GWRR (a distinguished from RR)
- 1 CO per chrm
- bounds of gwRR, not well understood
- HetC is not just sex chromosomes
- differences in gametogenesis
- not many empiracal measures, we find variation within subspecies
- within and across population framework
