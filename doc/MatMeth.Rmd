# Mouse Husbandry


To access natural genetic variation for *Mus musculus*, wild derived inbred strains were used. The Mus musculus PWD/PhJ, PERC/Eij, WSB/EiJ, LEWE/EiJ, MSM/MsJ, MOLF/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, CZECHII/EiJ were purchased from Jackson labs (Maine, USA). The strains of KAZ/TUA, TOM/TUA, AST/TUA, and HMI/TUA were cryo-derived from Biological Resource Center (BRC) at Riken (Ibaraki, Japan).  (https://en.brc.riken.jp).
The related species of *Mus caroli* CAROLI/EiJ and *Mus spretus* SPRET/EiJ were purchased from Jax labs (https://www.jax.org) and *Mus spicilegus* SPIC/Eij from Riken. 

 All mice were housed UW-Madison Biotech and MSC facilities - following the protocols.  A breeding colony of wild derived 
*Mus musculus* mice sampled from Gough Island (GI)is maintained at UW Veterinary school facilities.
 Mice were feed on dry standard breeder chow. Some strains sunflower seeds, nestlets and larger cages were added to improve fertility and litter survival. Adult mice were euthanized by CO asphyxiation. Neonate and embryonic mice were euthanized by decapitation following the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Over the course of data collection some breeding colonies  mice were moved from facilities. Additionally the GI strain was kept at a separate facility.  (evidence for environmental (room) effect on (MLH1 / SC lengths / a variety of meiotic traits was tested for. We observed no effect, Supplemental figure))



# Tissue Collection and Immunohistochemistry

Spermatocyte spreads were collected and perpared as described in [@peterson_2019] . The majority of mice used were between 5 and 12 weeks, (supplemental table). However some strains had problems breeding, so testes from older mice were collected. We found a (small/no) age effect on MLH1 counts for male mice (Supplemental Figure)). 

The only difference between preparation of spermatocyte and oocyte spreads was the volumns of the hypotonic buffer was 300 u l instead of 3ml.

The vast majority of oocyte data was collected from neonate litters/mice between 5 to 48 hours. This approach maintain breeding pairing and still result in prophase oocytes (cite timeline of oocytes in neonates). (differences were assessed between embryo samples and neonates?). Precise staging of embryos by checking copulary plugs was difficult/not feasible in many of these wild derived strains due to their behavior. Embryonic samples were collected when pregnancy noted in females, embryos were staged based on (X table markers).


Meiocyte spreads were made following [@peters_1997]. For testes the tunica was removed and whole testes was incubated in 3ml of hypotonic solution for 45min. For ovaries after dissection, the pair of ovaries were decapsulated in cold PBS and both were incubated in 300ul of hypotonic solution for 45 min.

After incubation, gonads were transferred to sucrose solution -for mastication to make a cell slurry which was transferred to 80ul of 2% PFA solution. Cells were fixed in this solution and dried in a humid chamber at room temperature overnight. The next morning, slides were treated with a photoflow (Kodak, cite) wash.


Staining / Immunohistochemistry

The same staining protocol was applied to spermatocyte and oocyte spreads.
The staining protocol was based on X with some adaptations, and same as previously described in Peterson et al 2019.

# Image Processing

Images of cells were capture using a Zeiss Axioplan 2 microscope with AxioLab camera and Axio Vision software (Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). 

Preprocessing, including cropping, noise reduction, and histogram adjustments, was performed using Photoshop (v13.0).

For MLH1 pachytene characterization, Cells with a full karyotype (19 acrocentric bivalents and XY for spermatocytes or 20 acrocentric bivalents for oocytes), distinct foci, and intact bivalents were included for quantification.
Reprocessing in Photoshop (cite). Image file names were anonymized before manual scoring of MLH1 or DMC1 foci.

Repeatability was assessed by X (comparing mulitple counted images)

Hand measures of meiotic chromosomes generated by using ImageJ/Fiji (v1.52) [@fiji].

The total SC per cell and single bivalent measures were generated using the approaches discribed in [@wang_2019_sc] and [@peterson_2019] respectively.



# Statisical Analysis


MLH1 counts per cell are good /decent proxies for genome wide recombination rates estimates (cite).

The distributions of CO counts per cell was assessed for normality (supplemental figure). Mouse mean MLH1 count was used to get around the bad discreet nature of count data. (normality was confirmed with X distribution, supplemental figure). 

We chose to use a **mixed model framework** to interpret the patterns of variation, built using the lmer4 package (cite) in R (v3.5.2)[@Rstudio].



The use of wild derived inbred strains enabled us to design an utilize a mixed model for our analytical framework. We built our model to predict the strain average MLH1 count per cell. The main effects and their interaction of subspecies and sex were coded as fixed. While, strain (or genetic background) was coded as a random effect to reflect a random sample of natural genetic variation from each subspecies. A strains to have a specific sex effect was also included.

This model allows us to estimate and test the fixed effects (sex and subsp), and variation in mean MLH1 counts due to strain effect. We use the subspecies term as a way to quantify between group variation (or divergence) and the random strain effect to quantify within group variation (or polymorphism). (in a sex specific manner). From the mixed model the estimates of heterochiasmy (sexual dimorphism) are a combination of subspecies and strain specific sex effects.

We can also compare the size of the sex effects between (subspecies) and within (strain) mouse groups. (ie is the male or female strain effect larger? is there more variance due to random strain effect in male or females?)
(we used this frame work as proxy for 'polymorphism' and 'divergence' in MLH1 counts across house mouse and closely related species.)
I may have to do more research/reading on testing the random effects.


-specific R packages
-non-parametric  (tests and measures for dealing with count data)
-hypothesis tested (size, DSB number)




**outline**

1. framework for analyzing the MLH1 evolutionary patterns across mus species complex. (what is the main question we were tackling when designing this framework?)

2. write equation, describe terms (proxies for within and between polymorphism)
logic / choices for fixed and random effects

3. what are the 2 general / basic questions this framework can be applied to.

$X \sim mouse average MLH1 ~ sex + subspecies + random(strain) + \xi $

4. how can DMC1 measures be added to the mixed model

5. descriptions of mlh1 outside of framework (missing female data)
