# Mouse Husbandry


To access natural genetic variation for *Mus musculus*, Wild derived inbred strains strains were used. PWD/PhJ, PERC/Eij, WSB/EiJ, LEWE/EiJ, MSM/MsJ, MOLF/EiJ, CAST/EiJ, CZECHII/EiJ, CORLI/EiJ and SPRET/EiJ were purchased from Jax labs (https://www.jax.org) (Maine USA). The strains of KAZ/TUA, TOM/TUA, AST/TUA, HMI/TUA and SPIC) were cryo-derived from Biological Resource Center (BRC) at RIKEN (Ibaraki, Japan) (https://en.brc.riken.jp/). All mice were housed UW-Madison Biotech and MSC facilities - following the protocols.  A breeding colony of wild derived mice sampled from Gough Island (GI )is maintained at UW Veterinary school facilities.
 Mice were feed on dry standard breeder chow. Some strains sunflower seeds, nestlets and larger cages were added to improve fertility and litter survival. Adult mice were euthanized by CO asphyxiation. Neonate and embryonic mice were euthanized by decapitation following the protocols approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

Over the coruse of data collection some breeding colonies / mice were moved from facilities. Additionally the GI strain was kept at a seperate facility.  (eviddence for environmental (room) effect on (MLH1 / SC lengths / a variety of meiotic traits was tested for. We observed no effect, Supplemental figure))



# Tissue Collection and Immunohistochemistry

From males, the right teste was collected and processed. (Ages are listed in supplmental material). Ovaries were collected from neonates less than 48 hours old or embryos between e16 to 21.

The behavior of these strains did not allow us to check for copulary plugs, resulting in most oocyte data coming from neonate mice between 5 to 48 hours.


Meiocyte spreads were made following [@peters_1997]. For testes the tunica was removed and whole testes was incubated in 3ml of hypotonic solution for 45min. For ovaries after dissection, the pair of ovaries were decapsulated in cold PBS and both were incubated in 300ul of hypotonic solution for 45 min.

After incubation, gonads were transferred to sucrose solution -for mastication to make a cell slurry which was transferred to 80ul of 2% PFA solution. Cells were fixed in this solution and dried in a humid chamber at room temperature overnight. The next morning, slides were treated with a photoflow wash.


# Image Processing


For MLH1 pachytene characterization, Cells with a full karyotype (19 autosomes and XY for spermatocyte spreads or 20 bivalents for oocyte spreads), distinct foci, and intact bivalents were included for quantification.

Reprocessing in Photoshop ()- Image file names were anonymized before manual scoring of MLH1 or DMC1 foci.

# Statisical Analysis

-done in R/ specific packages
-non-parameteric  (tests and measures for dealing with count data)

-hypothese tested (size, DSB number)
