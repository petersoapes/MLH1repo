## Mouse Husbandry


1.	(Specific strains were obtained from X vendors, 2.
2.	3 separate rooms used (precautions taken to ensure there was limited environmental variance) b. X additional husbandry things done to help with breeding of some mouse strains. housed in X conditions (extra things done for problem breeders,
3.	3. euthanized under X protocol,

X mice used


## Tissue Collection and Immunohistochemistry

1.	describe how gonad tissue was collected)  (right testes, both ovaries) (tunica removed decapsulated)  X protocol for testes,   X protocol for ovaries.  X ages for males, X ages for females
2.	 2. describe spread process   (describe process - clearly point out the distinctions for testes and ovaries
3.	3. (describe staining process (with DMC1)  (same process)



## Image Processing

1.	Basic quality criteria,
2.	Manual quant pipeline for MLH1 (anonimized)
3.	Quanti pipeline for DMC1 (not completely finished)


For MLH1 pachytene characterization, Cells with a full karyotype (19 autosomes and XY for spermatocyte spreads or 20 bivalents for oocyte spreads), distinct foci, and intact bivalents were included for quantification.



## Statisical Analysis

-done in R/ specific packages
-non-parameteric  (tests and measures for dealing with count data)
