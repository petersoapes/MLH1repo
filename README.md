### TODO:

- making strain specific reports, link the excel files (csv files) to these rmd pages
- add the passing report / make passing function
- make sure the full makefile works
- learn to make a pdf version of these reports
- make a table of contents



### trouble shooting

- duplicate data in MLH1_data:

  1. delete header.csv, big .. anon.csv files (remake them fresh)
  2. ran make MakeFile, (nothing to be done...) --- but it works when, "make data/big.csv"

initial - 3054
slimed down - 2781
  


### Image Preprocessing notes

Run join.py script with Python 3.3.5. Skimage, numpy, and tiffle should be installed. There is some imcompatibility with other versions of Python and tiffle (or skimage).
